# Random Password Generator

## Description

This Random Password Generator was created to generate a random and secure password based on the criteria the user inputs. It displays the password in the text box. This application helped me understand more about APIs and also showed me what I need to work on with JavaScript moving forward. I did have some trouble getting the password to input to the text box, so this will be something to improve upon. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When the user first sees the webpage, they can see a "Generate Password" button. When they click it, they will be prompted to enter a number for their desired password length, as well as confirm whether they want the mentioned password criteria. 

After that, they should be able to see a password in the text box where the text "Your Secure Password" once was. This password should match the criteria based on their input.
