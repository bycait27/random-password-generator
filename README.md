# Random Password Generator

## Description

This Random Password Generator was created to generate a random and secure password based on the criteria from user input. This application was made so that the user can easily copy a unique and secure password for anything they may need it for. When the user hits the 'Generate Password' button, they are prompted via the browser. Once they have given their responses, the unique password should be generated to the text box. This application could be redone in many ways to improve user experience, namely using a different method for user input. 

The following languages were used for this application: HTML for structure of the app, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the 'Generate Password' functionality.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When the user first sees the webpage, they can see a "Generate Password" button. When they click it, they will be prompted to enter a number for their desired password length and whether or not they want lowercase, uppercase, numeric characters, or unique characters in their password. Their newly generated password will be seen in the text box in place of 'Your Secure Password' and should match the criteria they provided to the browser.
